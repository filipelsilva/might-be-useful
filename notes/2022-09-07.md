# Vim: capture command output

I already knew about ```:![command]``` and ```:%![command]``` (run command and
show output, and run command with whole file as input, respectively), but to
capture a Ex command (not a shell one, as shown above) and send its output to a
buffer, one can use ```redir``` to send output of the next commands to a
register, which can then pasted with ```"[register]p```. Stop redirecting with
```:redir END```

```vim
:redir @a
:messages " Or any command
:redir END
```
