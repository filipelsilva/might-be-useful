# Thunar integration with Alacritty

I normally use alacritty with tmux, so much that it automatically spawns a tmux
instance if there is not one available at the moment. However, in Thunar, when
opening folders in the terminal, this means that alacritty opens, but not where
I want (usually, it appears as a copy of the terminal I already have, which
makes sense due to tmux usage). To prevent this from happening, and open a
one-off terminal for random stuff on folders quickly, to to "Edit > Customize
custom actions" and there, put the following command:

```
alacritty --command=$SHELL --working-directory=%f
```
